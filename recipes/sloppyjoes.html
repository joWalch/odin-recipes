        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>Homemade Sloppy Joes don't have to be difficult to eat. Despite the name of this iconic retro dish, the secret to a great Sloppy Joe <br>is a thick, rich, almost dry consistency, which allows the sandwich to be eaten with your hands. Serve on hamburger buns.</p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1 1/2 pounds extra-lean ground beef</li>
            <li>1/2 onion, diced</li>
            <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
            <li>2 cups water, divided</li>
            <li>3/4 cup ketchup</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons brown sugar</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon Dijon mustard</li>
            <li> 1 1/2 teaspoons salt, or to taste</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
            <li>1 dash of Worcestershire sauce</li>
            <li>1 pinch cayenne pepper, or to tase</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Place ground beef and onion in a large skillet over medium heat; cook and stir until beef is browned and crumbled, <br>about 10 minutes.</li>
            <li>Stir in green pepper and garlic; cook and stir until softened, 2 to 3 minutes. Add 1 cup water and stir, scraping the pan <br>to dissolve any brown flavor bits from the bottom of the skillet.</li>
            <li>Stir in ketchup, brown sugar, Dijon mustard, salt, black pepper, and Worcestershire sauce. Add remaining 1 cup water and <br>bring mixture to a boil. Reduce heat to low and simmer, stirring occasionally, until liquid has evaporated and mixture is thick, <br>about 40 minutes.</li>
            <li>Season with salt, black pepper, Worcestershire sauce, and cayenne pepper.</li>
        </ol>
